# Foto
Little tools to manage my foto workflow, mostly focused at keeping the meta data intact across various tools and devices. Often using JPGs with meta data and various editors can lead to complete loss of meta data for that file. So I use these little tools to keep the meta data flow inbetween sidecars and the actual JPGs,...so each tool find what it needs in the expected place.
